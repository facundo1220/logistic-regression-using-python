# logistic-regression-using-python

This is a project created based on the one explained in https://developer.ibm.com/articles/implementing-logistic-regression-from-scratch-in-python/, in order to implement a step-by-step logistic regression process with the objective of comparing its performance with that of specialized sklearn libraries for linear regression to verify the differences and implement new strategies for a better result with the use of optimizers.
